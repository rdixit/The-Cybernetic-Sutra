1. BRAHMANDA

The Brahmanda is the Cosmic Egg.

Latent and unmanifested within the golden egg is your Universe and all phenomena.

What is repeated on one scale, is repeated on every scale.

The birth of the cosmos from the Singularity.

The birth of the body from the zygote.

The cause of the non-dual manifesting the dual is the nature of the Brahmanda, which is Pure Consciousness.

The method of manifestion is the Kalachakra, the Wheel of time.




2. KALACHAKRA

The flow of Time is the basis of all perception and inference.

The turning of the Kalachakra symbolizes this flow.

The form of the Kalachakra is indivisible, occurring in space, having no characteristic scale.

Close to the hub of the Kalachakra, energy is concentrated, while further away it is more dissipated.

Inside the wheel, there are numerous concentric circles, intersecting with the 8 spokes.

These inner circles are removed by successively longer distances as one travels from the the center to the edge of the wheel.

The multiple divisions of the spoke thus formed by intersection with the circles are described by a power law.

Very high energy appears as the relative slowing of time- low energy, the relative speeding up of time. This can be visualized as inner and outer arcs on the Kalachakra.

At the Brahmanda, in the center axle of the Kalachakra, Time has no movement relative to the universe.




3. SHAKTI

From the sattva, rajas and tamas. 

The Consciousness of the Brahmanda gives rise to the duality of Shakti.

Shakti refers to energy and matter, which are interrelated, and are the underlying basis of the material Universe.

The evolution of the Brahmanda into Shakti occurs only in space and Time - the Kalachakra.

Shakti and the Kalachakra are mutually related by virtue of their common birth from that seed.

The effect is not different from the cause.

Hence, matter, energy, and time are each mutually interrelated, dependent on Consciousness.




4. INDRA'S NET
From the non-dual arise the dual, triplicate, and variously differentiated.

From the interaction of many simple parts, imbued with Shakti, operating according to rules given by the Brahmanda, complex phenomenon emerge by the turning of the Kalachakra.

As scale is inherently free due to the nature of Time and Space, what is repeated in one sphere is repeated in all spheres.

From the very simple and universal, to the very complex and specific, the Universe organizes itself in successive layers emergent from the layers below.

Indra's net is observed in all layers of the Universe, and at the base layer or Brahmanda in subtle and latent form.

Indra's net is like a glittering network of nodes, each of which becomes like unto a Brahmanda of its own right, and from which a new Indra's net can be born.

Many complex systems in the Universe can be represented by such networks of interconnected agents.

Communication in these networks is possible through Vac. 



5. VAC
Many ancient traditions describe the genesis of Man in the Word.

The word is a representation for a symbolic system of communication.

Symbols are "patterns" with meaning.

Knowledge, both static as in memory, and dynamic as in communication, flow from a set of collectively agreed upon symbols .

In humans of ancient times, a set of symbols evolved into the first Language.

Through Language emerged the building of complex social networks, trade, ancient cities and higher technological advances.

It's birth marks the true beginning of human civilization, as the supporting foundation upon which complex society is built. 

Similarly, the evolution of Indra's Net in general becomes accelerated by Vac.



6. OUROBOROS
The Ouroboros is of the form of a snake eating its own tail.

The Ouroboros represents feedback and a closed loop cybernetic network.

All directed self-organization occurs through feedback.

Learning and Memory, both natural and artificial, can determine the type of feedback.

Which can be positive, negative, or complex. 



7. SHAMBHALA
A perfect harmony is established through correct use of Indra's net, Vac, and the Ouroboros.

Since, as is apparently true, the Universe has no scale, this harmony can manifest itself on every scale, from the microscopic to the galactic.

When the cell, the brain, the body, the society, all creatures, the Earth and the surrounding planets are in harmony, it is known as the kingdom of Shambhala.




8. TANDAVA
All that is born, and sustained, must die.

The Tandava is the dance of destruction.

The end of the cybernetic society and the creation of a different order.

It is assured while the turning of the Kalachakra persists.

May peace be with all sentient life as long as that One wheel turns.

Introduction-- Networks, Neuroscience, Nirvana
 
Cybernetics was defined by MIT's Norbert Weiner in 1948 as the study of communication and control in the animal and machine. In groups of many such biological or mechanical agents acting together in concert, this communication takes on the abstract form of a "network". 

Networks are everywhere in our modern world. Physicists and other scientists use networks, and the mathematics which can be applied to them, to describe systems as diverse as airline transportation, cell biology, environmental sensors and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Most likely, you're reading this text as delivered through a network, the internet. Yet another network is actually processing and understanding the words on the screen- the biological network of neurons in your brain. 

Networks are everywhere, and they always have been. People talk about the "food chain" or "food web" that shuttles energy from the Sun, to crops, to livestock and onto your dinner table- this food web, too, is a complex network. From the inner working of our bodies and brains, to the global financial system and planetary ecosystem, networks are a way to understand, and thereby intelligently control, both the internal and the external environment.

The aim of the Cybernetic Sutra is fundamental redesign, and this hard-fought battle is won through means both internal and external. The first section of the sutra, Networks, describes the networks pervading our external world- communication, trade, environmental, government, social and technological- and their means of design and control. The second section, Neuroscience, provides a way of understanding and regulating the internal network, that which creates every joy, passion, fear and insight in our lives- our brain.

The final section, Nirvana, presents a series of case studies in the possible integration of the internal and external network science, and examines their potential benefits and pitfalls in relation to the current world system. This is an important section of the text, because we live in extraordinary and in many senses unparalleled times. The world is quickly becoming an interconnected electronic and biological network, linked as tightly by modern fiber-optics and global trade as it is by ecosystem dynamics and human relationships. The convergence of the natural and artificial worlds into a seamless whole comes at a momentous juncture in our species' history, and the possibilities in this modern era, be they beneficial, benign or even catastrophic, are now increasing as exponentially as our population and technological innovation itself. And yet, in the midst of so much opportunity for a better world, the global plagues of poverty, disease, disruptive globalization, dwindling food supplies, water shortages, war and climate change all seem beyond the preventive capabilities of the present-day governments. Through a careful application of the external and internal network science, we propose that the global citizens of the world take these matters, of such vital importance to us all, back into their own hands. Therefore, in keeping with this sentiment, this last section is open for submissions and feedback from anyone, living anywhere.

The time has arrived for a truly global citizens movement, and the Cybernetic Sutra hopes to be a coherent starting point for such a movement to begin its work. Nevertheless, the efforts of a grassroots, equitable, enlightened global citizens movement are unstoppable, with or without this text.

In the spirit of universal progress and a better future, we salute the sacred sisters Liberty, Knowledge, and Truth.

Networks--
external world- communication, trade, environmental, government, social and technological-





The fundamental premise of this text is that the world, our bodies and even our mind can be thought of as a network. By networks we simply mean individuals or things connected by relationships. That can include anything from people connected by friendship, neurons connected by synapses, or televisions, computers and satellites connected by a global telecommunications system. If you start to look carefully, you'll notice that networks underlie a lot of our everyday world. But if they are so common, why bother with the intellectual abstraction of "a network" at all?

Networks, over the past 20 years, have compelled researchers to create an entirely new field of science, called network science or complex systems science, with tools and concepts that we can apply, in a very practical way, to redesigning our own lives and societies. Whereas traditional sciences are very linear and mechanistic, with one event predictably leading to the next, complex systems are built from many individual components, acting together and often simultaneously, in a complex web of relationships that are interdependent on each-other. 

Take, for example, ant colonies. Individual ants are not that smart, and even more problematically they are also practically blind, communicating only by sensing and generating local chemical signals or pheromones on the surface of the earth through a process known as stigmergy. Each ant is assigned by birth to one of several very simple tasks: look for food, protect the young, build up the nest, and so on. No one ant either knows or has the ability to know what all the other ants are doing- they only focus on their local job, say, look for food and leave a chemical trail when they've discovered it, leading others to the food. Yet millions of ants, acting just like this in concert, are able to build complex ant societies that smoothly and efficiently function through these local interactions, forming a complex decentralized system that is so robust that ants can be found in abundance in almost every climate and country on earth. Why is a group of ants like this able to build and maintain such a seemingly complex society?

[FIGURE 1.1: ants using stigmergy]

We keep using the word "complex", because to a scientist trying to model this web of interactions on a computer, it really is a complex and often paradoxical situation. Often groups of even simple agents, like these ants, who play by only simple rules, can result in elaborate and highly organized "emergent" activity when they interact together. So on the one hand, these phenomenon, which are everywhere in our world, are complex. But on the other hand, they are both completely understandable and perfectly natural to us, because they are our ordinary, every-day experience. 

For example, my friend Jenn is a big fan of Shakira (the Colombian musician) and sees her wearing a certain pair of Converse shoes on television. The next day, my friend goes to the store, sees the same pair of sneakers on sale for $30 dollars, and buys them for herself. Since Jenn is known as a very fashionable person, other people begin to notice those sneakers and pretty soon they too are going to the store to buy a pair for themselves. The store manager notices all this activity around this particular pair of shoes, and decides to raise the price to $50. That's a bit too expensive, so people stop buying the shoes- the manager notices, lowers the price to $40, and the sales pick up again. 

Now who decided those Converse sneakers are worth $40? The store manager? My friend? The other customers? Or was it Shakira?

[FIGURE 1.2]

This whole toy example can be represented by the above network. It's a simple illustration that doesn't capture the situation in full, but notice that each actor in the diagram acts only on their own particular and limited interests: the manager wants to maximize profits, my friend wants to emulate Shakira, her friends want to appear fashionable, and Shakira perhaps has signed a marketing deal with the company making Converse sneakers. Yet acting together, a complex indicator like "price" is able to be exquisitely tuned to the correct level, even without any one of the actors knowing precisely what that price will actually be. 

Two other aspects of this situation can help illustrate some basics of networks: first, the "other customers" and the store manager are linked in a circular loop, and second that all the interactions are "direct" except Jennifer seeing Shakira wearing the shoes, which was mediated by the television network. The first point is a case of "feedback". The other shoppers buying the shoes cause the manager to increase the price, causing the shoppers to stop buying them, and thereby forcing the manager to lower the price. Feedback like this is a fundamental part of intelligent networks, and incorporating feedback into complex systems allows the intelligence inherent in these networks to actualize.

The second point is an example of the power of communication systems. Whereas the ants using stigmergy are only able to interact with local signals, humans through communication networks can be aware of events happening far outside their own local environment. The power of communication is the central force which drives cybernetic systems, and makes the possibilities of such systems so much more transformational. Therefore communication networks are our first subject.



COMMUNICATION NETWORKS

When cybernetics was ushered into existence in the mid 1940's, the world had just undergone a terrible and devastating world war. Norbert Weiner, a mathematician at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was among a small group of interdisciplinary scientists, academics and engineers who had been working, sporadically due to the war, on the new and very exciting field of electronic communication systems. This field came to be dubbed Cybernetics, and Weiner himself wrote the seminal text on the subject in 1948, called "Cybernetics: The study of control and communication in the animal and machine".

At the time, the very faintest traces of computers as we now know them were beginning to be created in labs across America and England. Extrapolating on the possible innovations that could arise from such systems, and, curiously, using biology and particularly neurobiology as a model, Weiner and others at the infamous Macy Conferences of the 1950's began to flesh out and attempt to discern the principles inherent in this new-born discipline. 

After some discussion, it appeared to Weiner and others that the fundamental necessities for any cybernetic system could actually be simplified to just two basic ingredients:
1) a communication system and 
2) feedback.

We can illustrate these two fundamental cybernetic components using the example of a 1950's anti-aircraft gunnery tower, one of the original applications from the post-World War II milieu.

[FIGURE 1-3: figure from Cybernetics by Weiner, or perhaps wikipedia, showing the automated gunnery towers for shooting aircraft]

Here, the automatic gunnery tower uses radar, then a relatively recent invention, to determine the location of an enemy airplane. It then checks the current direction of its own artillery cannon. These two values are used to create a vector which represents where and how fast the cannon should move in order to hit the target. The cannon then moves (automatically, quite a novelty at the time) to the calculated position, fires a shot, and then repeats the process again to fire the next round.

So what we have here is a 3 step process, repeated ad infinitum: 

1. Collect data from sensors (in this case the radar and the mechanoreceptors on the artillery gun)
2. Perform a calculation on the data (figure out the vector indicating the correct position for the gun to hit the target)
3. Do some action (either move the artillery cannon if needed, or fire a shell if the position is correct)
[repeat]

[Figure 1-4- auto gunnery network abstraction]

Again, this can be represented as a simple network, with individual actors (or "nodes", in network parlance) representing sensors, motors, computers, etc., and connections between nodes representing the sending of a signal from one component to another over a communication line. 

So the first necessary ingredient of a cybernetic application, a communication system, is the network of wires connecting the individual components (and the electrical signals they send over those wires.) But where is the feedback, the second necessary ingredient? As you might remember from the Shakira's Shoes example, feedback occurs whenever there is a circular loop in the network- here we again see such a circular loop, with the computer receiving signals from the two sensors, performing a calculation, doing something based on that calculation, and then sending requests for more information from the sensors again. This is exactly the same process that the store manager and the customers engaged in, except directly and not through a communication wire: the customers (or "sensors") sent a signal by buying or not buying, the store manager performed a "mental calculation" as to how he could maximize his sales, either changed or didn't change the price (action) based on his calculation, and finally sent a "request" back to the customers by gauging their demand for the newly priced shoes.

[Figure 1-5- Simplified Shakira's Shoes diagram showing same network arrangement as 1-4] 

These applications are still pretty simple, both in the complexity of the wiring of the network, and the number of components involved. But you might imagine that you could use the concepts of a communication network and feedback to do a lot more complex things, like, say, automatically run an automobile factory. For example, you could determine when and how many cars the factory should make (based on calculations from signals like customer demand), when and how many raw parts the factory should order (based on data from inventory levels), and whether to hire or fire workers (determined by, perhaps, the difference between the number of needed and actually produced cars.) 

Actually, you could do a lot of this, even in 1948, and today much of it falls under fields related to cybernetics called (more respectably, it would appear) operations research and management science. But given the basics of a communication network and feedback, just how far could you take this idea of automation? Could you use it to help run an entire society?

A man named Stafford Beers tried to do exactly that in the fall of 1971 in Chile. The government of Chile, a newly elected techno-socialist administration, wanted to create a centralized, automated network of factories to efficiently and cheaply make shoes, hats, and Walkman cassette players (etc. etc.) for its millions of citizens, and they hired Stafford Beers to help do just that. 





[FIGURE 1-6: photos of Stafford Beers here]



Beers himself was an academic and cybernetician from the University College London who jumped at the chance to try out his ideas, which were all on paper up to that point, on an entire country the size of Chile. The result of the operation looked like something out of a classic Star Trek set- a circular arrangement of huge, electronics embedded chairs controlling huge screens displaying real-time data coming from the dozens of factories being run by the project. 

Technically the purpose of the project was to create a national, near-instantaneous computerized system to run the entire Chilean economy. It did this through a network of 500 Telex machines positioned at factories all over the country, which sent signals like total output, inventory, and so on at daily intervals into the command center in Santiago. Feedback to the factories occurred by decision of the command room's computer and industrial experts, who sent the results of their analysis back to the factories by way of the Telex communication network. 

The Cybersyn project ran for only a little over a year, during which time Chile's economic indicators seemed to be better than or similar to the previously "pure capitalist" economy. According to Wikipedia, one of its successes was effectively organizing the shipment of food into Santiago during a massive 50,000 truck-driver strike, using only 200 non-striking trucks and the Telex network. A true test of the system over many years, however, never came; a U.S. backed military coup in 1973, and the subsequent ousting of the government, ended in the official suicide of the democratically elected President Allende and destruction of the control room and data-crunching computers.

The implication, however, had been made that such a cybernetic system might be viable and actually helpful to society. But the central pieces of the Chilean experiment, built in as they were in the 1970's, revolved around only 500 primitive Telex machines and relatively archaic computers. What type of outcome could we imagine emerging now, and on what kind of scale, given the mass adoption of computers, laptops, mobile devices and the internet?


"IT'S A SMALL WORLD, AFTER ALL"

In 1967, the Summer of Love in San Francisco seemed to portend a seismic shift from the straight-laced, authoritarian 1950's to the hippie, flower powered communitarian revolution. Equally important, but sometimes overlooked, was a Psychology Today article published by Stanley Milgram in the same year entitled "The Small World Problem". 

Milgram was a Harvard psychologist who was interested in methods of quantifying social interconnectedness. Starting with a wildly popular short story by Hungarian author Frigyes Karinthy in 1929, many lay people and academics alike had wondered just how interconnected society really was. To test this idea directly, Milgram and his colleagues sent more than 200 letters to randomly selected people in the United States, along with the name and city of a complete stranger who was designated the "target". Each of the 296 recipients were asked to forward the letter to a personal acquaintance who might help forward the letter to the eventual target. Each letter was designed to hop from one friend to another, recording each jump as it went through the chain of friendship until it reached the target individual.

Milgram found that, on average, the letters took only 6 intermediate people to reach the randomly-picked final person. What this meant, essentially, was that any two people in the United States were only separated by around 6 mutual acquaintances!

[information about hte original 6 degrees experiment in the United States, mention Chains the hungarian short story.]

The experiment brought into parlance the term "small world", as in, "Gee, it's a small world, isn't it?" In certain conversations with complete strangers, you may suddenly come to realize that you have a mutual friend which you didn't realize, and you may even remark about what a small world it is. This phrase originates from Milgram's experiment. The small-world concept is also used in network science, one of the prime subjects of this book, and it's been formalized into an easy to understand model of why people really are separated by such a small number of mutual acquaintances.

[Figure 1-7: the three pictures of a totally local, a totally centralized, and a small-world net. Include A and B nodes, as per discussion underneath]



In a completely local environment, like the colony of ants from the example in the introduction, if you wanted to pass a message from ant A to ant B, you would need to successively jump through almost half the nodes in the network until you finally reached your destination. This is what is known as "local" or completely grassroots network connectivity. The network has the advantage of being very stable, in the particular sense that if some disaster were to befall 5 or 10 random ants, the message would still be passed through. The disadvantage to this network is that it is very inefficient, since you might imagine directly passing the message to a "post-master ant", who could more quickly deliver it to the final recipient.

That second situation, called the "centralized network", implies that each ant is connected only to one central "post-master ant", who directs all traffic and messages. This seems great, on an initial look, because now each message gets passed to its recipient with only one intermediary. That means messages are always passed quickly through the network. But the disadvantage with a centralized model is that if the central node becomes knocked out for whatever reason, the entire network becomes "disconnected" and chaos ensues. This, incidentally, is probably why the failure of extremely centralized economies like the former U.S.S.R. happened in such rapid and complete fashion- without the central "hub" node, the entire network immediately dissolved into isolated pieces and a host of new, less-connected countries emerged. 

The small-world network is a mix between these two extremes. It incorporates the local connectivity of the grassroots model, but interestingly, it also has a a few nodes that act as a "hubs" or post-masters in the network. These hubs are kind of like the friendly, popular kid who knows everyone at school- they are part of local groups of friends, but they also have friends outside of their local group. The hubs in a small world network act like "shortcuts" when passing a message around- you just hop over to your local hub, send the message through him, and you can be sure the message will get through quickly to its recipient. 

A small world network is faster than a completely local network because of these "hub nodes". But it's not as fast as a totally centralized network. The advantage of the small-world net is how incredibly resilient it is in the face of any breakdown in the network- a random shutdown of 5 or 10 random nodes will likely miss the hub, and even a targeted striking at the hub node itself will still leave the entirely local connectivity route open for message passing. It is probably because of this stability that the small world network structure has been repeated literally thousands of times throughout evolution in different species, different natural systems, and even (seemingly "by accident") in completely man-made networks like airline transportation routes and the connections between people who exchange email. This structure can be described as a "power law", which is a generalized mathematical way of understanding the small-world network phenomenon. Power laws are the subject of much research today in physics into "universality"- systems which, although seemingly different, really can be described in the same underlying way.

[Provide reference for email network structure being small world and a one liner about people exchanging mail becoming an edge, etc.]

Here is a partial list of the places where scientists and researchers have found power laws already:

[FIGURE 1-8- perhaps combining the list above into the graphic on one side. We show a picture of the degree histogram of a small world network, showing the proliferation of local connections, with a couple hub nodes on the "long tail". Maybe explanation about long tail here in caption or the text?]

We don't fully yet understand why power laws are found everywhere in the Universe, whether manifested in networks as the small-world structure, in physical systems as fundamental forces like electromagnetism and gravity, in the populations of major cities, the frequency of earthquakes or the design of our own brains. What we do know, however, is that in the context of the small-world network, power law connectivity profiles give these networks an an ideal combination of stability (due to local grassroots connectivity) and speed (due to the central hub nodes.) These two factors, stability and efficiency, correspond to twin fundamental principles of local and global, segregration and integration, protection and openness. The delicate balance of these in the small-world network is the key to understanding why these networks are so successful. We will use these twin principles of local and global connectivity, and their balance, to help us understand the communication networks in our world.



"THE INFORMATION AGE"

With an understanding of small-world networks, and their power, we can start practically applying these network concepts to our world as it exists right now. In [2000], we proclaimed the beginning of the Information Age on [the cover of some magazine like Time? ] What did that actually mean?

[stats about mobile penetration, computer penetration, internet penetration. Show graphs of adoption of the various techno. over time, starting in, say, 1973.]



MOBILE PHONES FROM THE TOP-DOWN

Particularly revolutionary has been the mass adoption, all over the world, of cheap mobile phones with at least simple SMS capability. In fact, the trend is towards the emergence of a variety of so-called "smartphones', computers-in-miniature which have their own operating systems, user-designed applications and access to the internet.

Given the situation on the ground today, however, smart-phones are not a practical possibility right now in many places in the world. But the proliferation of cheap mobiles with SMS has already occured. With that embedding of communication technology around the globe has come new ideas and new applications for mobile technology in people's lives. 

Ushaadi- for reporting of election results and...?
MPesa- mobile banking in [Kenya?]
FrontlineSMS in [Where?]- healthcare, NGO organization
Reuters and SMS in India- mobile farming updates, weather etc.
The fish farmers and the market conditions in [where in Africa?]


These just scratch the surface of what can be done with a cheap SMS capable phone. In fact, an entire new research field called ICT4D (Information and Communication Technology For Development) has sprung up in the last 5 years, largely around the possibilities inherent in having so many mobile phones around the world.

WIFI MESH FROM THE BOTTOM-UP


Self-organized Community ISP:





The universal rules and dynamics that have been discovered in the study of networks have been applied to almost every field of science, including physics, systems biology, chemistry, computer science, seismology, management, neuroscience, sociology, and electrical engineering. The fascinating conclusion that all these seemingly disconnected areas can actually be boiled down to a single, underlying framework has been mostly, although not entirely, confined to academic discussions in professional journals. We won't bother with academic publications, luckily, and will simply apply these concepts straight-away in our practical lives.

The simplicity of the network, as a concept, is a powerful discovery that can be used to re-think and re-evaluate our entire society: our financial system, our relationship with our ecosystem, even our government. However, some basics about networks will be helpful for us in thinking about how to go about this.

(Use data from sensor networks to e.g. calculate total groundwater supplies, refill rate, total number of users of the groundwater and then determine a set amount each person can use. For each person using less than said amount from water pumps fitted with such sensor data reception ability- a rebate is issued in netcoins. No extra charge is given for using more than your supplies. However, by incentivizing good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, the system of conservation is better adopted. This is incidentally the central rule in conservation by CNS- incentivize good behavior, don't punish bad behavior. Another way of incentivizing good behavior is public feedback- i.e. publishing water usage statistics given the recommended quotas to everyone in the network, using shame (!) in a public sense to regulate public use of resources.

BADLY WRITTEN, JUST THINKING/WRITING OUT LOUD HERE--
the 4 chamber government is built with feedback in mind as a central principal. With a voting system like, for example, in the United States during a Presidential election, only 1 winner can emerge from each district, who each have a certain number of electoral "points" based on their population. This type of system discourages third party candidates, who can never win the majority at the district level, but who may have sizeable constituencies in the country as a whole. This represents an example of a system with poor feedback mechanisms, since the "will of the people" is not expressed to its most eloquent (or, thinking computationally, most "precise") degree. 

In the 4 chamber LETS Parliament, the entire funding structure for the Congress is dependent on the grassroots local CNS level. Each local CNS sets aside 10% of its total funds for the District LETS, 1% of its total funds for the State LETS, and 0.1% for the National LETS Parliament. At election time in a gien chamber, all the funds from all local LETS destined for that chamber are counted and put in the Electoral Funds "Pot". Each chamber, therefore, will have a certain amount of funds available at election time; this money is the funding by which major activities of the chamber must be conducted. 

Since each local LETS has contributed money for this chamber, they all have a say in who should decide how to spend the money. Rather than voting for a single representative to do this in a traditional one-vote system, the total funds for the chamber are divided by the total number of people voting in all the local LETS, resulting in each individual person having a certain amount of "funding". Let's say that amount is $100 dollars. 

Let's illustrate it with an example:
In a given District Chamber election, the total number of funds from all the Local LETS was $10,000. There were exactly 10 Local LETS who belong to the District, and although some LETS are rich and some poorer, they all gave 10% of their funds for the election, with the grand total coming to $10,000.


[FOOTNOTE: (this number represented each Local LETS in the district giving 10% of their total average total funds, as calculated over the period of the previous electoral cycle. This, incidentally, prevents local LETS from spending heavily right before the election to reduce their contribution to the pot, and still "gaming the system" by excercising the egalitarian "equal funding" voting rights designed for the LETS system.) It does not prevent, however, Local LETS from only putting their money into the LETS bank after the election has passed, but the cost for this will by necessity then be born in the next election cycle.]


Let's assume there are 100 people in every Local LETS, so the total number of people voting in the election is 100*10=1000 voters. So according to the formula, we have the total funds, $10,000, and divide that by the total number of voters, 1000, coming to $10 per voter.

In a traditional voting system, a voter will choose one candidate, and that's the end of the story. However, that system has problems, discussed more in depth below. Here the voter can spend his $10 in support of one candidate, two candidates, or any number of candidates he likes. He could in fact even vote by spending the money on himself. Any, and that means any, LETS member who received funds in the election is automatically joined in the LETS Parliament. However, popular candidates will have lots of funds, and less popular candidates, much fewer. This amount will be in proportion to the voters actual preferences, rather than artificially streamlined into narrow partisan or sectarian divisions. Any registered voters who do not cast their electoral funds will have said funds pooled together, and distributed evenly to all LETS members of the chamber.

Any member of the LETS Chamber (which can have any number of members) can propose a bill. Through debate and discussion, using the same feedback and up/down ranking systems as used in the Local LETS, the bill is eventually brought to a funding vote, which passes by winning support from members with at least enough funds to accomplish the task. Funding for the bill comes only from its supporters. In the event that not enough funding is secured, the bill fails. If more funding than is required is found, the excess is returned to the respective contributors in proportion to the amount of which they gave.

------------
LETS Courts Asikde- 
Challenges to the bill given any encroachment on the rights of the minority or other liberties can be always made to the respective LETS Court. However, the LETS Court also serves a more fundamental role in managing these legislative processes. Say one group of Parliamentarians wants to build a road in a certain area, and they have the funding to do so. Another group wants to build a hospital in the same area, and they also have the funding to do so. How does this stalemate resolve itself, since both have the cash-on-hand to effect their bills, but both bills cannot be viable?

The LETS Courts can be appealed to in order to resolve the dispute. LETS Courts are ideal men and women with meditative dispositions, allegiance to the basic human rights and liberties enumerated in the Brahmanda/Constitution, and should be beyond likes and dislikes and serve their duty with only the cause of dharma in mind. Therefore, these men and women naturally entail respect and the ability to resolve disputes. Since the LETS Chambers are essentially no different than the LETS themselves, we simply have again that ancient division in society between the monks, and the lay-people. Such a division is balanced, insofar as the monks remain uncorrupted, and the LETS people maintain trust in the monks to resolve disputes. Without this central balance, the system falls apart, since inherently (and unfortunately, at least during this stage of evolution) most humans are selfish, greedy and can quickly become violent to serve their own ends. Hence harmonious society depends on the "other", the monk order, and the LETS Courts which mediate disputes, strike down un-Constitutional laws, and serve as a moral guide to the people in an informal sense.

But where is the concept of feedback here? The LETS Courts must remain uncorrupted by offers of money and so on from interested parties in the LETS, since the Courts have a powerful hand in shaping policy even at a practical level, as they must resolve disputes and anyone can appeal to them at any time. Hence a corrupted District Court could be appealed to by a District member who has bribed those in the Court, and an unfair decision could be awarded to him. It's conceivable that since such unscrupulous behavior was then rewarded by a favorable decision, other LETS members may vote to fund him in the next election since they perceive he can get things done! I believe a way to stop such behavior would be to completely open everything about the LETS Courts and their member's lives to the public. Every aspect of their life must be known if they choose to participate in the LETS Courts, because they are invoking a very great trust in the people, and that trust must not be broken else the system cease to function properly. Monks who do not wish to deliberate in the Courts have no such compunctions, although by proximity to the Courts they may incidentally have portions of their lives exposed. 

But again, the concept of feedback is still not formalized. Since the communication network and "sensors" are collecting information about their lives, the data is there to make decisions. But who will make those decisions? If the entire monk order is corrupted, the signals, while being in the open, can simply go unheeded... corruption must be against the law in the Brahamanda, and hence evidence of corruption should elicit police reponses from the LETS Chambers. Other feedback can actualize in the form of new recruits to the monk order coming from the grassroots layers who have intentions to uphold the spiritual integrity of the LETS court. 
HOW ABOUT THIS:?
The national Courts are all subject to approval votes/funding at the death,retirement or dishonorable discharge of a Monk in the current seat. This is relatively the slowest form of feedback (life appointments, potentially) but gives the LETS some say in who can be at the top levels of the Monk order. Since each decision can be appealed all the way to the top of the LETS Court, this gives some level of safety against total corruption in the system.
------------------

This allows all those interested in staying involved fully in the legislative process, to do so, at any level of Parliament they choose. They simply have to vote for themselves during the election, and thereby enter the Chamber. However, if they do not attract support from many others, they will necessarily have limited individual clout, and will be forced to network with other members of Parliament to actually pass any bills. But, their voice will still be heard, however muted it may be. However, those who have no interest in making and voting on bills can simply pass their electoral funding along to the candidate or candidates they most trust to make decisions in their own and the greater public's interest.

Actually, the Greek roots of the world Cybernetics comes from kybernan, meaning to govern. Kyber-netes is literally[???] "helmsman", as in one who moves the helm of a sea-faring ship to control the movement of the rudder. The image of a helm is imprinted on the first page of this text, in honor of, amongst other concepts, the idea of the helmsman from kyber-netes.
